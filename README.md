# Amazon Alexa Sentiment Analysis

![Amazon Alexa Logo](https://logodix.com/logo/787260.png)

## Overview

This project performs **sentiment analysis** on Amazon Alexa user reviews using advanced machine learning techniques. The model predicts whether a given review is **Positive** or **Negative** based on the review's text content. By leveraging **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning**, we achieve good-accuracy sentiment classification to gain valuable insights into user experiences with Alexa.

## Streamlit Web Application

## Dataset

The project uses the Amazon Alexa Reviews dataset, which contains:

- rating (1 -5 )
- date
- variation
- verified_reviews
- feedback

Total number of reviews: 3150

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Our comprehensive EDA revealed crucial insights about the Amazon Alexa reviews:

1. **Sentiment Distribution:**
   - Positive reviews: 91.87%
   - Negative reviews: 8.13%
   
   This imbalance was addressed in our modeling approach to ensure fair classification.

2. **Word Frequency Analysis:**
   - Most common positive words: "love", "great", "easy", "awesome", etc.
   - Most common negative words: "disappointing", "difficult", "frustrating", etc.

3. **Review Length Analysis:**
   - Average review length: 50 words
   - Positive reviews tend to be shorter (avg. 45 words)
   - Negative reviews tend to be longer (avg. 60 words)

4. **Rating Distribution:**
   - 5-star ratings: 72.59%
   - 1-star ratings: 5.11%
   - Strong correlation between rating and sentiment

5. **Temporal Analysis:**
   - Sentiment trends over time show improvement in user satisfaction
   - Seasonal patterns observed (e.g., more positive reviews during holiday seasons)

6. **Device-specific Insights:**
   - Echo Dot received the highest proportion of positive reviews
   - Fire TV Stick had the most mixed sentiments

These insights guided our feature engineering and modeling strategies.

## Preprocessing

Text preprocessing steps include:
1. Lowercasing
2. Removing special characters and numbers
3. Tokenization
4. Removing stop words
5. Lemmatization
6. Handling negations

## Modeling

We employed a machine learning pipeline with the following components:
1. **Text Vectorization:** CountVectorizer with n-grams (1,2)
2. **Feature Scaling:** StandardScaler
3. **Classifier:** XGBoost

Hyperparameter tuning was performed using GridSearchCV to optimize model performance.

## Evaluation

The model's performance was evaluated using:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score
- ROC-AUC

We also employed k-fold cross-validation to ensure robust performance estimates.

## Usage

### Running the App Locally

To run the app locally, follow these steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/iamgopinathbehera/Amazon-Alexa-Sentiment-Analysis.git
cd Amazon-Alexa-Sentiment-Analysis
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

### Example Usage in the App:

1. **Single Input Mode:** 
   - Enter a review in the text box
   - Click "Predict Sentiment"
   - View the predicted sentiment and confidence score

2. **CSV Mode:** 
   - Prepare a CSV file with a "text" column containing reviews
   - Upload the CSV file
   - View batch prediction results and sentiment distribution visualization

## Results

Our XGBoost model achieved:
- Test Accuracy: 94%
- Precision: 94.8% 
- Recall: 98.5%
- F1 Score: 98.6%

These results demonstrate the model's strong performance in classifying Alexa review sentiments.
